# Coco Healthcare Assistant Frontend

This is the frontend of our Project Coco Health Assistant

## Purpose

Coco Healthcare Assistant application aims to address the critical healthcare challenges faced by many individuals in our province, where accessing timely medical care is difficult due to a shortage of family doctors and long wait times at walk-in clinics. This app provides immediate, reliable assistance to users experiencing health issues, helping them make informed decisions about their care.

## Project Intent and Idea

Inspired by the pressing need for accessible healthcare, this project leverages machine learning to guide users on what steps to take based on their health information and symptoms. The application features a virtual assistant that interacts with users in a friendly manner, collects necessary information about their condition, and provides personalized recommendations. The assistant can advise users on whether to visit a hospital, seek emergency care, or handle minor conditions with home remedies or immediate actions for serious situations.

The ultimate goal of this project is to reduce the burden on the healthcare system and offer users a dependable resource for medical guidance, ensuring they receive the care they need without unnecessary delays.
